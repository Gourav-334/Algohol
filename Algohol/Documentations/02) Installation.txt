The installation steps are very simple, just follow them without skipping any instruction:-


Step 1: Decide whether you want to use a static or shared/dynamic version of the library.

Step 2: As per the decision, copy files from folder "Algohol (Dynamic Library Resources)" if you prefer to use shared/dynamic version of the library. Or for users preferring static version, copy files from "Algohol (Static Library Resources)".

Step 3: Paste the copied files to the same directory where your source code which have to use the library resides in.

Step 4: Open your source code file, and now you can include the header file and use its namespaces.


Precaution!
-----------

-> Make sure that you have the header file in the same directory of the source code using it.
-> Also make sure that library file (.lib for static & .dll for dynamic) are in the same directory of the executable (.exe) files using it.
