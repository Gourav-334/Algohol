SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY
---------------------

It has become a necessity to stay in touch with the developer community, in order to stay updated about the technology. Many developers also prefer to work alone without staying in constant touch with any kind of developer community, which is fine, but in a long run it may not be an efficient option. Its a personal suggestion to stay awared about the evolution taking place in your field (any), and it becomes easier when you are part of a developer community.

As it comes to C/C++, it has an ever existing huge community, though not as big as Java or Python (may vary). Most of these people belonging to C/C++ community, or simply its users, can be found on various platforms and help you out with your queries like:-

-> StackOverflow		(stackoverflow.com)
-> GitHub 			(github.com)
-> Codecademy Forumns		(discuss.codecademy.com)
-> Reddit-r/learnprogramming	(reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)
-> GeeksforGeeks 		(geeksforgeeks.org)
-> CodeProject 			(codeproject.com)
-> HackerRank 			(hackerrank.com)
-> LeetCode 			(leetcode.com)
-> Quora 			(quora.com)

Remember, that most important thing is self-learning through self-discipline. Community backs you up, but the main protagoninst of your story are you.
