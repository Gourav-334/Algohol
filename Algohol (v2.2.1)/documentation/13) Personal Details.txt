PERSONAL DETAILS
----------------

My name is Gourav Kumar Mallick, and I am right now a 2nd year Computer Science & Engineering student belonging to Odisha. I am not much physically active, also not performing much spiritual activities, some major parts requiring improvements. I want to study Upanishads, but too busy for not being able to read Bhagavad Gita, being a software engineer.

Currently I am aiming to improve my skills of figuring out algorithms with low time & space complexity, along with a strong enthusiasm in learning x86 Assembly Language for system critical performance of programs.

I am not aware about social media stuffs, so I am naturally not active on it. I don't have accounts on any popular social media accounts other than PDBee & LinkedIn, cause I don't see any point in it and trying being away from stress of world, lol haha. Anyway, I am on LinkedIn though.
