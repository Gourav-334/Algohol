CONFIGURATION AND CUSTOMIZATION
-------------------------------

Consider following points before/when customizing:-

-> In namespace structures, the private section of each class contains variables used for counter, storing temporary variables, some pointers pointing to data structures etc.

-> Rest of the code under public section are expected to be optimized.

-> Some identifiers may not represent the original working/role of it.

-> Codes under public section are fine, and easily customizable.

-> When disassembling anything from private section, be careful considering its effect on rest of the code.

-> No restriction on changes to any extent, but making changes with codes in private section is not advised to beginners.

-> For header file used for creating dynamic link library, the macro used as exchange for __declspec(dllexport) & __declspec(dllimport) is SHARED.

-> The SHARED token is used only in classes, as using them in functions raised errors saying __declspec(dllimport) is expected to be used in functions.

-> Try not modifying the macro tokens used for avoiding multiple imports from taking place, specially try not to replace them with "#pragma once" as it is not always portable.
