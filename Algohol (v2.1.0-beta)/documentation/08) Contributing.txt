CONTRIBUTING
------------

It would be extremely helpful for every developer using this library if someone contributes. I tried to initiate it from my side with goal of achieving a great learning outcome and even a great milestone. If someone contributes to this open source project, I appreciate him/her.


Areas expected for improvement:-

-> The time complexity of the code, specially the binary search tree.

-> The space complexity of the code, using minimal variables and eliminating unwanted/unsused ones.

-> Making the code cleaner.

-> Providing meaningful and easy instructions through comments to the user.

-> Enabling macro SHARED (for __declspec) to be used on generic functions present.

-> Enabling direct inclusion of header file, containing prototypes.

-> Object, static and shared files for MacOS & Linux users.
