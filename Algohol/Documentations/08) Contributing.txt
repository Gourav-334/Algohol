CONTRIBUTING
------------

It would be extremely helpful for every developer using this library if someone contributes. I tried to initiate it from my side with goal of achieving a great learning outcome and even a great milestone. If someone contributes to this open source project, I appreciate him/her.


Areas expected for improvement:-

-> The time complexity of the code, specially the binary search tree.

-> The space complexity of the code, using minimal variables and eliminating unwanted/unsused ones.

-> Making the code cleaner.

-> Providing meaningful and easy instructions through comments to the user.
